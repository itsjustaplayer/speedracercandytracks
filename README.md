Speed Racer: Candy Tracks is a restoration and preservation project based on Toppsâ€™ Candy Tracks, an Adobe Shockwave game developed by Blit Interactive. The goal of this project is to restore the original Speed Racer assets and media that were removed from the final version of the game after the movie promotion ended in 2008.
