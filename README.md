## 📖 Overview
**Speed Racer: Candy Tracks EXPANDED** is a modification expansionist project based on *Topps’ Candy Tracks*, an Adobe Shockwave 3D racing game developed by **Blit Interactive** in 2008.

When the *Speed Racer* movie promotion ended, the game was stripped of its original *Speed Racer* assets and branding, leaving behind only a generic “Candy Tracks” version. This project aims to expand upon the Preservation mod, by readding functionality such as the login system, using a web-server, add more speed racer cars, more speed racer tracks, all fitting the overall art style.

## 🧠 About the Original Game
*Candy Tracks* was a 3D racing game that let players drive Topps' candy-themed cars through colorful tracks while collecting sweets and avoiding crashing. The original *Speed Racer* edition featured branded cars, track banners, and objects based off the 2008 film — all of which were later removed due to the 08' Promotion period ending.
